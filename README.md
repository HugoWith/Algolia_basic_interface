### THE PROJECT

## STACK

VueJS
SCSS
HTML

I've chosen VueJS because I felt like I could won some times for the test by using this Framework.
I had implement Algolia places in another project which was in Vue So it felt natural to start this test with the stack above.
I've also Use the boilerplate that Algolia offers.

## DURATION

I would say it took me between 3 and 4 hours to do it. I took a lot of time to follow the Algolia docs.

## ALGOLIA SET UP

I've set up Algolia with the help of the dashboards. I didn't felt lost the docs are very precise
I've made some try and learn/fail to come up with this result.
Some of the filters option are not really the best for the users, but I wanted o try some possibilities. I didn't get the chance to use Algolia ratings because I was using Teds Talks dataSet.

## TO GO FURTHER

I didn't have the time to make the datas more readable (views, popularity, duration) but if I had more time I think it would have been my next task.
The website is not full responsive. If I had the time I would have use CSS Grid on the whole page to make it responsive on mobile (it is actually responsive until 650px.)
Because I used the boilerplate from Algolia the CSS naming is a mix between the BEM method which I use, and the Algolia naming. So I think it is also a thing to work on.

## QUICK NOTE

The .env file will be send in the email about this test. I didn't really wanted my API keys on a github public repo ðŸ˜Š

## CONCLUSION

Thanks a lot for letting me try this test. It was very interesting, I've learn a lot about Algolia. There is some improvement to do, it's not a one page website I'd get into production for one of my clients but with a little more work I think I could.
Let me know what you think ðŸ˜Š
